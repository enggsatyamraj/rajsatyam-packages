# ui69

Unstyled, accessible UI components for React Native, inspired by shadcn/ui.

## What is ui69?

ui69 is a collection of reusable, customizable UI components for React Native. Unlike traditional component libraries, ui69 doesn't publish the components as a package. Instead, it provides a CLI that adds the components directly to your project. This gives you complete control over the components, including the ability to customize them to fit your needs.

## Features

- üöÄ **Copy and paste** - Components are added directly to your project
- üí™ **Customizable** - Modify components to fit your specific needs
- üîç **Accessible** - Built with accessibility in mind
- üìù **TypeScript** - Fully typed components
- üì± **React Native friendly** - Works with both Expo and React Native CLI

## Installation

```bash
# Install using npx
npx ui69 add <component>

# Or install the CLI globally
npm install -g ui69
ui69 add <component>
```

## Usage

```bash
# Add components to your project
npx ui69 add button

# List all available components
npx ui69 list
```

import { Skeleton } from './components/ui/skeleton';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 16, gap: 8 }}>
      {/* Default shimmer animation */}
      <Skeleton width="100%" height={20} />
      
      {/* Wave animation */}
      <Skeleton 
        width="80%" 
        height={20} 
        animationType="wave" 
      />
      
      {/* Custom styling */}
      <Skeleton 
        width={60} 
        height={60} 
        borderRadius={30}
        backgroundColor="#c0c0c0"
        highlightColor="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)"
      />
      
      {/* Custom animation speed */}
      <Skeleton 
        width="90%" 
        height={16} 
        duration={2000} // Slower animation
      />
      
      {/* No animation */}
      <Skeleton 
        width="100%" 
        height={20} 
        animationType="none" 
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Accordion Component Example

  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"

export function AccordionDemo() {
  return (
    
      
        Is it accessible?
        
          Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern.
        
      
      
        Is it styled?
        
          
            Yes. It comes with default styles that matches the other
            components' aesthetic.
          
        
      
      
        Is it animated?
        
          
            Yes. It's animated by default, but you can disable it if you prefer.
          
        
      
    
  )
}
